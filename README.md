# Machine-Learning

A repository for all of my machine learning projects solved for [Coursera Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). Here I have uploaded my solutions along with details about the projects. All my solution codes have detailed documentation.
To point out, I have modified the assignment codes according to my needs. This may not produce the same results as that on the real assignments.
